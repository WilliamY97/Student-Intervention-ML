    "\n",
    "**2) Naive Bayes:** As mentioned during the unit, Naive Bayes can be applied to document classification and spam filtering. This classifier works by using Baye's Theorem (an equation that calculates likelihood of hypothesis based on evidence/prior probability) to try and classify data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires only a small training set to estimate necessary parameters.\n",

    "- Makes an assumption that all features are independant which is not necessarily true.\n",

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

We are looking for accuracy in our classification on whether or not a student requires further assistance to ensure we can help the majority of them before it is too late. The SVM classifier boasted the highest F1 score out of the three that I chose and so it had the highest testing accuracy. This will allow us to help the most amount of students which do need help. Although the prediction time for the training and test set for SVN was the longest, it was not far off from the time taken from the other two classifiers. I believe it is better to have higher testing accuracy than computation time and so SVN is my choice.\n",

If there is no stick that can seperate the balls well, then you can throw the balls in the air (kerneling) and slide a sheet of paper (hyperplane) between the balls as to seperate them. "
